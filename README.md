# Insights_Challenge

Wasn't able to run this on the test, but it works on my machine. I'm not sure if I set up the run.sh correctly. 

To run, I cd to the src folder and execute python script.py

my result has an error where the product and date are combined in one column. Ran out of time as I was working it out. 

Thank you for the review!
